Node .js with Express framework has been used for this project.
Database used is MongoDB.
I have utilised the GUI of Robo T3 for creating the tables.
Postman has been used to test the REST API.
I have created the tables- users and events which I have initially populated with some documents. Then I haved added a new user and a new event using the POST method of REST API.
